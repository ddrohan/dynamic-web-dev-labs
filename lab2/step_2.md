# Step 2 - Setup

First thing you should do is download the starter code (or the solution to the previous lab) **[here](../zips/donationweb-1.0.solution.zip)** and then extract it to your single parent folder for all your web app projects you created for Lab 1. 

It's not vital, but you should probably rename the extracted folder, and remove the 'solution' postfix.

So, once you've extracted the archive (and dragged it into Sublime Text) you should have something like this.

Navigate to your **donation-web-2.0** folder and load the **index.html** page in a browser to confirm everything is as it should be to begin with.


## Navigation Bar

Our Nav bar now has 5 links, and 2 buttons, like so

So the rest of the lab involves adding functionality to allow the user to

* **Donate** and
* **View All Donations**
