# Step 2 - Setup

First thing you should do is download the starter code (or the solution to the previous lab) **[here](../zips/donationweb-1.0.solution.zip)** and then extract it to your single parent folder for all your web app projects you created for Lab 1. 

It's not vital, but you should probably rename the extracted folder, and remove the 'solution' postfix.

So, once you've extracted the archive (and dragged it into Sublime Text) you should have something like this.

Navigate to your **donation-web-2.0** folder and load the **index.html** page in a browser to confirm everything is as it should be to begin with.


## Navigation Bar

You'll notice that the navigation bar has only 3 links, and 2 buttons, like so

diplaying some basic info.

Investigate the code behind these pages and familiarise yourself with how these pages are ***controlled*** as we will build on these concepts in the rest of the lab.

The next few steps involve adding 2 new pages
