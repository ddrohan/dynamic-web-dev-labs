# Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the next version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **Donation 2.0**.  We will build on the previous lab. So you can either use your own version of **Donation 1.0** or download the starter code  In this version we will just set up the 'links' we need in our app and introduce some basic **controllers** and **routes**.  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* design an initial layout for the app
* add some basic **controllers** to manage your pages (your **views**)
* implement basic navigation using the **ngRoute** dependency
* be able to use **templates** and the **ng-view** directive
