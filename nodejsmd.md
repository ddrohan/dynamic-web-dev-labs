Instaling [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is pretty much essential for any modern web development, so if you haven't got it installed already, you can install it (and the Node Package Manager npm) [here](https://nodejs.org). 

There's also some useful info here - [Installing Node.js and updating npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
