#Lab 1 - DonationWebStorm (Express & Node Web App using WebStorm)

In this lab we're going to build a very simple Node Web App using the **WebStorm** IDE. If you haven't done so already, get it set up by following this guide here.

won't be adding any extra functionality as such, but more importantly, we will be developing a Web App with a **NodeJS** back-end using **express** to scaffold it, with an **AngularJS** front-end.
