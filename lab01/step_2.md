# Step 2 - Setup

![](../lab01/images01/lab01s01.png)

We're going to build our first Node/Express web app using **WebStorm**, so (assuming you already have it installed) launch your WebStorm IDE and create a new Node/Express Project as follows;

So select 'Create New Project' and you should get something like this

Select a 'Node.js Express App'

and browse to the location you want to store your project files. It's probably a good idea to store all your web apps in a single folder (ssd4 for me here) and create a new folder for our specific web app **donationwebstorm** (as below).

and make sue you choose **EJS** as the templating option (more on this later)

![](../lab01/images01/lab01s05.png)

As you can see below, this will auto-generate a node web app, creating all the necessary folders and files we need to get started. *EJS* specifies we want to use the **Embedded JavaScript Templates** (instead of the default which is Jade).

Now, click on the 'play' button to run/launch your Web App..

If everything goes to plan you should be able to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, and see the following

Now, if you'd rather your browser launch automatically you can configure you 'Run' options

![](../lab01/images01/lab01s09.png)

and choose the Browser you prefer

Just be sure to 'tick' the 'After Launch' check box

The next step will involve customising our home page (although customising is a bit of a stretch!)
