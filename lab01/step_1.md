# Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build a simple Node/Express Web App (using WebStorm), called **DonationWebStorm**.  We will use the WebStorm IDE to do most of the initial setup for us. 

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* create a skeleton **NodeJS** app using **express** 
* run this app as a **NodeJS Server**
* customise the Node Server Landing (Home) Page
