The first thing to do is go to the official JetBrains resources and get yourself an educational licensed version of their WebStorm IDE.

You can find the download link [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and the Student License application form [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

We'll look at the IDE (and its features) in detail as we work through the labs.
