#Lab 3 - Donation 3.0 (Express, Node & Angular App)

Up to this point, we've been working locally (no Server running) and just rendering our local files to the (Safari) Browser. From now on, thing will get a lot more interesting in that we will be building a proper client-server web app, using NodeJS for the server-side stuff and reusing our AngularJS code for the client-side.
