# Step 2 - Setup

First thing you should do is download the starter code (or the solution to the previous lab) **[here](../zips/donationweb-3.0.zip)** and then extract it to your single parent folder for all your web app projects you created for the previous labs. 

It's not vital, but you should probably rename the extracted folder for your final version of DonationWeb.

Before beginning any refactoring it's probably worth running the Web App, just to confirm it launches correctly and we see the expected navigation bar (as below).


## Navigation Bar

Our Nav bar now has 5 links, and 2 buttons, like so

So the rest of the lab involves adding functionality to allow the user to

* **Donate** 
* **View All Donations** and
* **Delete a Donation **
