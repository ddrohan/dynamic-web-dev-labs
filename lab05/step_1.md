# Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the next version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **DonationWeb 4.0**.  We will build on the previous lab, so you can either use your own version of **DonationWeb 3.0** or download the starter code **[here](../zips/donationweb-3.0.zip)**. In this version we will be updating our **controllers** and our **factory** to introduce some functionality into our Web App.  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* list all donations 
* add and delete a single donation
* be able to use **callbacks**
* be able to use **templates** 
* be able to use the **ng-view**, **ng-model**, **ng-repeat** (and a few other) directives
