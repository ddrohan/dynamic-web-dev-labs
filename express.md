# Express Setup

![](images/node-express.jpg)

Before you install [express](http://www.expressjs.com), make sure you have [node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed already.

Go to the command line and type the following

```
npm install -g express
```
That's it - you now have express installed!

if you type 

```
npm install -g express --save
```

within your project folder, it will add express to your dependencies (but we'll cover that later on).
