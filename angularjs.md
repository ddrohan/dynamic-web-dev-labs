Visit the official Angular JS resources and set up your development environment as instructed.

You can find nearly everything you need [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/contribute) but you won't need to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Bower](http://bower.io/) for what we'll be doing in the labs (though you might need them for other modules you're taking).

I'd also recommend installing [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) and setting up either a [bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) (my personal favourite!) or [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account (if you haven't got one already) to manage versioning control of all your labs. 

Once you have SourceTree installed, you can easily set up a local git repository and sync it up remotely with you bitbucket account as described [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Create+a+repository). It's probably best to set it up from the command line first and then just 'drag-n-drop' your folder onto the SourceTree app - and you're done!
