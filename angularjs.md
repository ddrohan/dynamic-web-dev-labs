# AngularJS Setup

![](AngularJS-large.png)




The first thing to do is go to the official Angular JS resources and set up your development environment as instructed.

You can find nearly everything you need [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/contribute) but you won't need to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Bower](http://bower.io/) for what we'll be doing in the labs (though you might need them for other modules you're taking).

I'd also recommend installing [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) andsetting up either a [bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) or [GitHub](http://www.github.com) account (if you haven't got one already) to manage versioning control of all your labs.
