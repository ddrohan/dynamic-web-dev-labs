Before you attempt any of the labs, I'd recommend downloading and installing [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) to use as your JS editor - you can use any text editor you like, but I'll be using Sublime Text.

You can visit the live site [here](https://donationweb.herokuapp.com/), to get an idea of what you'll be developing throughout the labs.
