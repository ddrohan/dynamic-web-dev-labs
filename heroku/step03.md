# Step 03 - The Heroku Toolbelt

At this stage you can now create repositories and manage you projects and files through git and Bitbucket + SourceTree. To actually deploy a Node Web App to Heroku you need the <b>Heroku Toolbelt</b>. 

The Heroku toolbelt will give us access to the Heroku Command Line Utility, as well as git, (tools weâ€™ll use later).

After you've installed the Toolbelt, you have access to the heroku commands. Go into your command line and type:

$ heroku

Visit your Heroku Account online to confirm your app was created successfully.
