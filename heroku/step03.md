# Step 03 - The Heroku Toolbelt

At this stage you can now create repositories and manage you projects and files through git and Bitbucket + SourceTree. To actually deploy a Node Web App to Heroku you need the <b>Heroku Toolbelt</b>. 

The Heroku toolbelt will give us access to the Heroku Command Line Utility, as well as git, (tools weâ€™ll use later).

After you've installed the Toolbelt, you have access to the heroku commands. Go into your command line and type:

~~~
$ heroku
~~~

You get a full list of the available Heroku commands, but we'l only be using a few of them.

The next step is to login to your (already created!) Heroku account, so at the command line, type
~~~
$ heroku login
~~~

and enter your Heroku credentials

Now type
~~~
$ heroku create donationwebtest
~~~

where 'donationwebtest' is the name of the web app you wish to create.

<b>Note : the web app name needs to be unique, so if a node web app already exists with the name you've chosen, you'll get an error</b>

You can always leave the name empty

~~~
$ heroku create
~~~

and Heroku will generate a random web app name for you?

Visit your Heroku Account online to confirm your app was created successfully.
