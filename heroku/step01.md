# Step 01 - Requirements

For reference, I mainly used this [link](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-node-js-app-to-heroku) to put these steps together.

Before you can deploy to heroku using this lab you need to have the following downloaded & installed and/or setup

1. Heroku Account (so visit [Heroku.com](http://heroku.com) and create one)
2. [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org)
3. [Heroku Toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)
4. [Git](http://git-scm.com)
5. [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) or [GitHub](http://github.com) Account (I'll be using Bitbucket here)
6. [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) (make sure you have this one installed before progressing with the actual lab)
