# Lab 1 - Donation 1.0 (Angular App)

This lab will introduce you to your 1st Angular Web App - **Donation 1.0**

It won't actually do much at this stage, but it will get you started on some of the basics of what constitutes an Angular App and set up the navigation and pages we need for the final MEAN Donation Web App.

Don't worry too much if we haven't covered all the concepts in the Lectures yet - just follow the steps in the lab and we will eventually sync up the labs with the lectures.
