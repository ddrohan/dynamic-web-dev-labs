# Step 1 - Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the first version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **Donation 1.0**. We will build on this lab (and the Case Study) over the following weeks and add in some new features along the way. In this version we will just set up the 'links' we need in our app and introduce some basic **controllers** and **routes**.  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* design an initial layout for the app
* add some basic **controllers** to manage your pages (your **views**)
* implement basic navigation using the **ngRoute** dependency
* be able to use **templates** 
* be able to use the **ng-view** and **ng-controlle** directives
