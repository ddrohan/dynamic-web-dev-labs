# Setup

First thing you should do is download the starter code **[here](../zips/donationweb-1.0.starter.zip)** and then extract it somewhere you can access it at the command line easily. I'd recommend creating a single parent folder for all your web app projects as we'll need to access these folders quite regularly in later labs. 

It's not vital, but you should probably rename the extracted folder, and remove the 'starter' postfix.

So, once you've extracted the archive (and dragged it into Sublime Text) you should have something like this.

We'll have a closer look at the individual files as we work through the lab.
