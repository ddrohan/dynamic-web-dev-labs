# Step 2 - Setup

First thing you should do is download the starter code **[here](../zips/donationweb-1.0.starter.zip)** and then extract it somewhere you can access it at the command line easily. I'd recommend creating a single parent folder for all your web app projects as we'll need to access these folders quite regularly in later labs. 

It's not vital, but you should probably rename the extracted folder, and remove the 'starter' postfix.

So, once you've extracted the archive (and dragged it into Sublime Text) you should have something like this.

We'll have a closer look at the individual files as we work through the lab, but first (and to see what our Angular app currently does) navigate to your **donation-web-1.0** folder and load the **index.html** page in a browser.


## Navigation Bar

You'll notice that the navigation bar has only 3 links, and 2 buttons, like so

diplaying some basic info.

Investigate the code behind these pages and familiarise yourself with how these pages are *controlled* as we will build on these concepts in the rest of the lab.

The next few steps involve adding 2 new pages
