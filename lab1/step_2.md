# Setup

First thing you should do is download the starter code - [here](../zips/donationweb-1.0.starter.zip) and extract it somewhere you can access at the command line easily. I'd recommend creating a single parent folder for all your web app projects as we'll need to access these folders quite regularly in later labs.
