# Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the last version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **Donation 5.0**.  We will build on the previous lab, so you can either use your own version of **Donation 4.0** or download the starter code **[here](../zips/donationweb-4.0.solution.zip)**. In this version we will be implementing a ***MongoDB*** backend (and reusing our previous solution).  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* create a full **NodeJS** app using **express** 
* run this app as a **NodeJS Server** and process client requests
* be able to use **npm** to install dependency modules
* be able to create **client-side** requests in **Angular** and render the results in our **Views**
