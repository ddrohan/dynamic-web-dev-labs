# Step 6 - Adding our 'Routes', Part 2 ('Add', 'Delete' & 'UpVotes')

Recall our routes, described as follows:

* GET **/donations** - return a list of donations and associated metadata
* POST **/donations** - create a new donation
* GET **/donations/:id** - return an individual donation with associated metadata
* PUT **/donations/:id/upvote** - upvote a donation, notice we use the donation ID in the URL
* DELETE **/donations/:id** - delete a donation by ID

We've already implemented the first one, so now let's have a go at 

* Adding a new donation
* Deleting a donation and
* 'Upvoting' a donation

We'll leave finding an individual donation for the final lab - Lab 5.
