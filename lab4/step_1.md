# Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the next version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **Donation 4.0**.  We will build on the previous lab, so you can either use your own version of **Donation 3.0** or download the starter code **[here](../zips/donationweb-3.0.solution.zip)**. In this version we will be creating a new web app from the ground up (and reusing our previous solution).  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* create a skeleton **NodeJS** app using **express** 
* run this app as a **NodeJS Server**
* be able to use **npm** to install dependency modules
* be able to build the **client-side** of our **Donation 4.0**
