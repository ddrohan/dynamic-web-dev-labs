# Step 7 - Updating our 'Views', Part 2

As with Step 5, we need to wire up the angular frontend to allow donations to be

* Added
* Deleted
* Upvoted

---
## Updating 'donateController' with 'POST' request

---
## Updating 'donationsController' with 'DELETE' request

---
## Updating 'donationsController' with 'PUT' request


---
## Updating our .ejs pages

There's actually very little required for this part, and if you followed the previous step closely, ***especially the implementation of the routes in donations.js*** you should be able to make the minimal changes in **donations.ejs**

Once you've made all these modifications and updates, you should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), and use all the features of the web app (except update :-) )

##Well Done!!!!
