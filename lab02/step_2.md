# Step 2 - Project Setup

We're going to build our first Node/Express DonationWeb project, so (assuming you already have it installed) launch your WebStorm IDE and create a new Node/Express Project as follows;

Select 'Create New Project' and you should get something like this

Select a 'Node.js Express App'

and browse to the location you want to store your project files. It's probably a good idea to store all your web apps in a single folder (ssd4 for me here) and create a new folder for our specific web app **donationweb-1.0** (as below).

and make sue you choose **EJS** as the templating option (more on this later)

![](../lab01/images01/lab01s05.png)

As you can see below, this will auto-generate a node web app, creating all the necessary folders and files we need to get started. *EJS* specifies we want to use the **Embedded JavaScript Templates** (instead of the default which is Jade).

Now, click on the 'play' button to run/launch your Web App..

if you've folled all the steps correctly you should be able to run your app (or visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) and see the following
