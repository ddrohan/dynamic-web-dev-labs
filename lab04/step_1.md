# Step 1 - Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to build the next version of our Donation Case Study Web App, called **Donation 3.0**. We will build on the previous lab (and the Case Study) and add a basic Angular front-end on our existing Web Server. In this version we will just set up the 'links' we need in our app and introduce some **controllers** and **routes**.  

On completion of this lab you'll be able to

* design an initial layout for the app
* add some basic **controllers** to manage your pages (your **views**)
* implement basic navigation using the **ngRoute** dependency
* be able to use **templates** 
* be able to use the **ng-view** and **ng-controller** directives
