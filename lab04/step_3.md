# Step 3 - Implement the 'About Us' Page

This step involves adding another navigation link to our navigation bar to take the user to an 'About Us' page, like so

## Updating the Navigation Bar

Adding the link is quite straightforward so open up your **index.ejs** page in your 'views' folder and add the following html code to the list of links

```html
<li><a href="#about"><i class="fa fa-info"></i> About</a></li>

```
Save the file and a quick reboot of the app should display the expected result.

##Adding 'about.ejs'

We'll keep this page fairly simple for the moment so create a new file (about.ejs) within the **'pages'** directory/folder of your **'public'** webapp folder and place the following html inside it, 

like so,

and then

```html
<div class="jumbotron text-center">
	<h1>About Us</h1>
	
	<p>{{ message }}</p>
</div>
```

##Wiring it all up - the 'About Us' Controller and Routing

This is where most of the work needs to be done in-so-far as we need to  

* create a new ***controller*** object to manage the page and
* add a new ***route*** to ensure the link is correctly associated with the **controller**

###Adding the Controller
First, open up your **app.js** file and navigate to where the other controllers have been implemented (around line 36 if you haven't added anything)

Add the following code **AFTER** the *'donationsController'* controller (line 53+) - feel free to change the message!

```javascript
app.controller('aboutController', function($scope) {
    $scope.message = 'Look! I am an about page.';
  });
```
###Adding the Routing
Finally, within your **app.js** file, navigate to where the other routes have been implemented (around line 12 if you haven't added anything before it)

![](../images/lab1.step3.2.png)

Add the following code **AFTER** line 31 **AND BEFORE** line 32 (so make some space!)

```javascript
// route for the about page
            .when('/about', {
                templateUrl : 'pages/about.html',
                controller  : 'aboutController'
            })
```

Once again, make sure you save your file before you refresh in the browser. If all goes to plan you should now be able to navigate to the **'About Us'** page and see your message displayed.
