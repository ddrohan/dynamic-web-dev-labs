This is where you can find all the labs for **Dynamic Web Development**.

We will be covering the MEAN Software Stack which essentially covers Mongo, Express, Angular and Node when developing web applications in the context of developing a RESTful Web Service for an Android App [Donation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ddrohan/android-101-labs-as/details).

The labs will begin with a simple Node Web Server built using Express and progress on to a fully fledged MEAN web app, with an Angular Front End. 

You can check out the completed web app connected to a mongodb database hosted on [mongolab](http://www.mongolab.com) deployed to [heroku](http://www.heroku.com) here [http://donationweb-4-0.herokuapp.com](http://donationweb-4-0.herokuapp.com).
